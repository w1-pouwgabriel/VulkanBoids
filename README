- Download Vulkan SDK ( https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/ ) 
- Make sure the entry VULKAN_SDK is specified within your environment variables
- Restart your PC ( this is the easiest solution for our system to reinitialize with the new environment variable )
- Within your repository folder run `cmake -Bbuild` ( this should generate a "build" folder with your solution in it )
- Run your .sln file
- Happy coding ;-)
